# scripts_from_HEs_in_cpDNA_project
The various oddly specific but maybe useful scripts I have written for the homing endonucleases in Chlorophyta chloroplast/plastid genomes project. Do not fret I will be providing descriptions of each script organized by what segment of the project I created them for in here, I am just quite a busy gal at the moment. I will also revisit them and try to improve their efficiency/optimize complexity, for now they just get the job done.
